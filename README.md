## My process

### Workflow

- Preparing workflow (Installing React, Adding assets, Prepating README.md)

- Identifying and creating components
  - RateInput, RateResult

- Working on mobile design based on `design` folder and `style-guide.md` file

- Working on desktop desing based on `design` folder and `style-guide.md` file

- Adding Rate component to manage rating functionality and common styles 

- Working on React functionality

- Completing README.md

- Publish on github.com | nelify.app | frontmentor.io


### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [CSS modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet) - For styles
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

React functionality was tricky, passing data and events to children and getting data from them was the point of this challenge

### Continued development

Read more React and some day I must read React animation libraries

### Useful resources

- [cooler.co](https://coolors.co/) - I used this site to generate a color between 2 colors
